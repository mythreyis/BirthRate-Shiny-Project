Analysis of Birth Rates across the US (1990-2009)
----------------

The objective of this project is to analyze the changes in birth rates across the US in the years 1990 - 2009. Analysis is presented in the form of the following.

**Choropleth**

The US choropleth shows the birth rates across the US in a particular year. The slider can be used to change the input value of the year to see the overall trend in birth rates over the years. 

**NVD3 Line Chart**

The NVD3 line chart shows the birth rate changes in individual states over the years. This tool helps to compare the birth rate changes across different states.

By default, only the checkboxes for Alaska (the state with the highest birth rate in year 1990) and Vermont (the state with the lowest birth rate in year 2009) are selected. 

When a state is selected/unselected, the corresponding birth rate line appears/disappears in the chart. When none of the states are selected, the line chart disappears. 

**Data Table**

The data used for this project is available as a data table in this section. It was obtained from Quandl (Quandl Code: CDC/42512_40827_00).
